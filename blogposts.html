				<h3>Milroy's in London</h3>
					<h4>October 10th</h4>
					<img class= "main-image" src="img/oct10th-5.jpg" alt="photo of the speakeasy bar">
						
						<p>This was my first time travelling across the pond. London is one of those cities you feel right at home immediately upon arrival. It was an amazing experience. We spent most of our time there sight seeing during the day and enjoying pubs at night. Highlights included a Fullers Brewery tour, the Tower of London and a bourbon themed speakeasy called Milroys. At Milroy I got a chance to speak with some local bourbon aficionados. I was surprised to learn that there is a thriving population of bourbon enthusiasts in London. We tasted a Michter's 10 year old Barrel Strength, then went through a secret door disguised as a bookcase, down to the speakeasy for a cocktail.  I had a Michter's Rye Manhatten. I'm a huge fan of Michter's so this cocktail was a safe bet all the way. I plan on visiting London again next year and Milroy's will most definitely be on my list of places to visit.

				<h3>Tasting at Michael Veach's Home</h3>
					<h4>October 17th</h4>
					<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="img/oct17th-1.jpg"><img class="main-image" src="img/oct17th-1.jpg" alt="photo of three bourbons and food accompaniments"></a>
						
						<p>
						This week's tasting included three bourbons: the Maker's Mark Private Select 8UP, Belle Meade 9 year old Sherry, and Jeffersons's Ocean Special Wheated Mash Bill. For me, the Jefferson's was best neat. It carries a delicious salted caramel flavor with a hint of buttercream. No need to cut this one with water or ice, it's a smooth finish. One of my current favorite bourbons right now.
						For my particular tasting accompaniments I've decided to go with Dried Apricots, Almonds & milk chocolate chips. The Maker's and milk chocolate pairing stole the show. It replicated a cordial cherry with a bit of alcohol. Win win. I have yet to pair the chocolates with a bourbon of equal compliment. In the end, I'd say of these three, I'd sip on the Jefferson's Ocean first and foremost, although if there's any type of chocolate around I'd reach for that Maker's bottle without a second thought.

				<h3>Myrtle's Punch House in Cincinatti</h3>
					<h4>October 24th</h4>
					<img class= "main-image" src="img/oct24th-1.jpg" alt="photo of two punch flights at Myrtle's Punch House">

						<p>
						This Wednesday, my girlfriend and I took a trip to Cincinatti. We had lunch and a pint at the Hofbrau House then went to see Mystery Science Theatre 3k Live! What a phenomenal show, I haven't laughed that hard in ages. Afterwards, we decided to check out a place called Myrtle's Punch House. We had previously met the creator, Molly Wellmann, at a bourbon society event where she was a featured speaker. She wasn't there that night which was a bummer, but I had the chance to try a flight of her highlighted punches. The bourbon punch "Jungle Jolia" ingredients consisted of bourbon (of course), lime, blackberry sage, and white earl grey tea. The earl grey stood out as the main flavor with slight hints of the blackberry and lime coming through. It was my second favorite of flight with my personal favorite being the rum infused  "Jamaican Classic". This gem had jamaican rum, lime, strawberry syrup and all spice drams. Initially the sweetness of the strawberry and tart lime have control of the pallette until a late kick of all spice welcomes in a warm cinnamon tone on the back of the tongue. Truly a brilliant combination. Especially, it being a particularly warm night in October, this fruity punch served well. I truly wish I had more time to try more of the punches but sadly we made it only an hour before closing.

				<h3>Tasting Mike's 10 month old!</h3>
					<h4>October 31st</h4>
					
					<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="img/oct31st-1.jpg"><img class="main-image" src="img/oct31st-1.jpg" alt=""></a>

						<p>
						This week Mike invited Rebecca and I to join him for a tasting of his 10 month old bourbon. Now, I won't disclose the mash bill statement but it was created with a rare corn which to my knowledge has not been used in any bourbons currently on the market. 

						 Michael selected Kentucky Artisan Distillery to distill and store. After a brief tour of the distillery we ventured out to the warehouse where Mike's barrels are stored. We opened the four barrels and pulled a glass from each. I was surprised to find that each barrel elated it's own unique flavor. I found barrel four to be my favorite, with exuberant tones of cocoa, buttercream, sweet corn. Everyone partaking this day agreed, this bourbon could turn into something very special. If it already taste that good after ten months, then I'm truly excited to see how this one turns out after it's had a few years to mature.
