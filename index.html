		<h2>ABOUT ME BUT MOSTLY BOURBON</h2>
			<p>

			In 2009, I was hired to manage the  historic Louisville local theatre Apex Village 8. Almost immediately I fell in love with the city, a big city feel with plenty of  small town charm and a florishing local scene especially music, food and of course bourbon. I admit before moving to Kentucky, my knowledge of bourbon didn't go much further than a Jim Beam and Coke. It wasn't until I met and befriended a few bourbon enthusiasts that I realized bourbon isn't just a spirit, it's a huge piece of Kentucky history. So it goes with any new found fascination of mine I began exploring a plethra of different bottles from J.T.S Brown to Pappy Van Winkle, enjoying every session. Around late 2016, My aunt introduced me to Michael Veach, a bourbon hall of famer and local celebrity. We started doing tastings on Wednesdays and well the rest is history. Since then I've taken bourbon history classes, toured multiple distilleries, met master distillers, etc. I've enjoyed this oppurtunity so extensively that I felt a great need to share my experiences with anyone who cares to listen. So here's my blog Bourbon on a Wednesday, a weekly update on my bourbon adventures!!! Cheers!
